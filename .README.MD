# Schwab Webhook Application

## Overview
This project is a Node.js backend application that enables secure trading on the Schwab platform via webhooks. It provides a simple API for placing stock orders using Schwab's OAuth2 authentication and trading APIs.

## Key Features
- **OAuth2 Authentication:** Securely authenticate users with Schwab.
- **Token Management:** Store and manage access tokens securely.
- **Order Placement Webhook:** Expose a webhook endpoint to place stock trades on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Modular Structure:** Organized codebase for easy maintenance and extension.

## How It Works
1. **User Authentication:**
   - The user is redirected to Schwab's OAuth login page to grant access.
   - After successful login, Schwab redirects back to the app with an authorization code.
   - The app exchanges this code for access and refresh tokens, which are securely stored.

2. **Placing Orders via Webhook:**
   - An external system (or user) sends a POST request to the `/webhook/place-order` endpoint with order details (symbol, quantity, instruction).
   - The app retrieves the latest access token, fetches the user's Schwab account ID, and places the order using Schwab's trading API.
   - The response indicates success or failure of the trade.

## Project Structure
- `server/` - Main backend code
  - `routes/` - Express route handlers (OAuth, webhook)
  - `services/` - Business logic for Schwab API integration
  - `models/` - Database models (e.g., for tokens)
  - `utils/` - Utility functions (e.g., token storage)
  - `db/` - Database connection setup
  - `server.js` - Entry point for the Express server

## Setup & Usage
1. **Install dependencies** in the `server` directory.
2. **Configure environment variables** with your Schwab API credentials and other settings.
3. **Start the server.**
4. **Authenticate with Schwab** by visiting the OAuth login URL.
5. **Place trades** by sending a POST request to `/webhook/place-order` with the required order details.

## Security Notes
- Store your Schwab API credentials and tokens securely.
- Use HTTPS in production to protect sensitive data.
